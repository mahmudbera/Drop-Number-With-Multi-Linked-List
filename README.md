# Drop-Number-With-Multi-Linked-List

This project is a Java implementation of a basic level 2048 game (Drop Number Game) using a multi-linked list data structure. The game is played on a 7x5 grid, where the objective is to combine tiles with the same number to create larger tiles until no more moves can be made.
